This is a [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) template based on [ModernCV for Typst](https://github.com/giovanniberti/moderncv.typst) which was in turn inspired by [moderncv](https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv), a LaTeX template.

## How to customize colors

Currently, the `project` function exposes three different color parameters:

* `main_color`: Used by left-side heading bars. The default color is "Verkehrsblau".
* `heading_color`: Used in headings text. It is the same as `main_color` per default.
* `job_color`: Used in the main job occupation text. The default color is red.
